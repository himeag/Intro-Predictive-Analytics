# Q1
Fit a model of purchased using all the available predictors. (Take care to follow the data preparation steps in the RMarkdown template carefully.) What is the accuracy of that model?

```{r}



```

# Q2
You would like to provide some guidance to AdviseInvest for which customers should be scheduled for a call based on the tree model’s class label predictions of which customers will purchase an AdviseInvest product. What proportion of the customers in the dataset would it make sense to schedule for a call? Assume that all the customers predicted to purchase (using the default setting in the predict function: type = “class”) actually will purchase.


```{r}

```

#Q3
Create a ranked contact list for AdviseInvest with the customers who have the highest model-estimated probability of purchasing at the top of the list. How many customers are grouped together at the highest estimated probability? Hint: create a table with the number of customers at each level of probability using the count() function.

```{r}

```

#Q4
Your contact at AdviseInvest has reported that utilization of sale representatives is currently at about 50% due to a poor answer rate. Could you use your model to improve utilization? Explain your answer.

```{r}

```

#Q5
Here is a profit curve for the AdviseInvest case with revenue per customer who purchases estimated at $100 and the cost associated with a call estimated at $25. We have assumed that all customers who were called will purchase a product. Given this result, approximately what percentage of customers should be called in order to maximize profit?

```{r}

```

#Q6
Reproduce the above plot and upload a screenshot of your code and the resulting plot.

```{r}

```


#Q7
Develop some recommendations for the client, the Director of Sales at AdviseInvest. To do that you will need to revisit the business problem and think about the business value of your models. For example, in modeling purchase and constructing a profit curve we have treated the business problem as one of profit. Would it make more sense to treat this as a problem of utilization instead, as originally suggested by the Director of Sales? What, concretely, would you recommend that AdviseInvest do? How should your analytical results be operationalized?

Write a paragraph or two in which you clearly describe and argue for your recommendations. You will be graded on the extent to which you are able to:

Precisely frame the business problem.
Use predictive modeling results to do prescriptive analytics.
Write clearly and compellingly without mistakes (such as spelling errors) and without relying on jargon. The Director of Sales is knowledgeable about analytics but is not an expert statistician.
Feel free to upload a plot if you think it would help you make your case.
