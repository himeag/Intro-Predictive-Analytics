Leads from our webform only answer our sales representatives' response calls 50% of the time, leaving them idle roughly 50% of their clocked time. This idle time is unevenly distributed throughout the day, with some hours full of conversation and other hours void of any dialog.

In the first three months of this project, our team will develop two classification models based on historical demographic, financial, purchasing, and call data (whether they answered and were on mobile) to predict whether a lead will answer or not and whether that lead will purchase a product or not. The sales team can use these models to prioritize each hours' call list by purchased, answered, and not answered to decrease the uneven distribution of calls answered among all associates. 

In the second three months of this project, we will create a third model to more effectively assign leads to reps to address the ultimate goal of increasing the amount of time each rep spends with leads to greater than 50%. We can use the first half of the project to collect two additional data points: the time of the scheduled call and the amount of time the rep was on the phone with the lead. We can use this additional data in the second half of the project to create a regression model that predicts the amount of time a lead will spend on the phone with a rep. Using this data, the sales team can optimize sales repsâ€™ schedules and lead assignments.
