### Data dictionary

- ANSWERED: Indicator for whether the call was answered.
- INCOME:  Annual income of customer
- FEMALE: Indicator for whether the customer is female
- AGE:  Age of customer
- JOB:  Indicator for  job type.
- NUM_DEPENDENTS:  Number of dependents.
- RENT:  Indicator for whether customer rents
- OWN_RES:  Indicator for whether  customer owns residence
- NEW_CAR:  Indicator of whether the  customer owns a new car
- CHK_ACCT: Number of checking accounts
- SAV_ACCT: Number of savings accounts
- NUM_ACCTS:  Total number of   other accounts
- MOBILE:  Indicator for whether the call back number is mobile
- PRODUCT:  Type of product purchased. (0 represents no purchase)

```{r}
#import data, remove product which is not known until after, and modify variables which should be factors
d <- read_csv("adviseinvest_clean.csv")  %>%
  select(-product) %>% 
  mutate(answered = factor(ifelse(answered==0, "no","yes")),
         female = factor(female),
         job = factor(job),
         rent = factor(rent),
         own_res = factor(own_res),
         new_car = factor(new_car),
         mobile = factor(mobile)) 

```




# Questions

## Q1.  
The target variable for this modeling exercise is ANSWERED.  In this dataset, what proportion of calls were answered?

```{r}
# answered true over total answered
sum(d$answered== 'yes')/sum(d$answered=='no' | d$answered=='yes')
```

## Q2.  
Fit a tree model to the outcome using just one variable, income. We'll call this the "income model." What is the accuracy of the income model?

```{r}

# fit tree
(income_model <- rpart(answered ~ income, data = d))

# accuracy of model
sum(predict(income_model, type="class") == d$answered)/nrow(d)

```

## Q3.  
What is the entropy in the income model's first terminal (leaf) node ?

The node is defined as:  2) income>=39135.  (If you are not seeing this output then make sure you have turned the outcome variable into a factor.)

### First terminal node

Split: income>=39135 

Total n for leaf: 1385  

Incorrect observations: 495 

Majority: no 

Proportion no: 0.6425993 

Proportion yes: 0.3574007

```{r}

# Calculate entropy - -p1*log(p1)-p2*log(p2)

-0.6425993*log(0.6425993) - 0.3574007*log(0.3574007)


```

### Q4.
Fit a tree model of the outcome using all the predictors (again,  not including product, and having changed the indicators and the outcome into factors).  We'll call this the "tree model."  Create and upload a visualization of the tree model. (This will be somewhat illegible due to the complexity of the tree.)



```{r}

(tree_model <- rpart(answered ~ ., data=d))

rpart.plot(tree_model)

```

### Q5.
What is the accuracy of the tree model?



```{r}
# accuracy of model
sum(predict(tree_model, type="class") == d$answered)/nrow(d)

```


### Q6. 
What is the top variable in terms of variable importance?


```{r}

tree_model$variable.importance

```
